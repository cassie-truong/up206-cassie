# Profile
Hi everyone! My name is Cassie Truong and I'm a second year MURP concentrating in Design and Development. I was born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley. I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with my B.S. in Urban and Regional Planning and have been working in the public sector for about six years. My goal as a planner is to design equitable and inclusive public spaces. In my free time, I enjoy trying new cocktail bars and restuarants, running, and reading!

I started 2023 unplugged at Death Valley National Park!

# Project Idea
I'd like to work on a project that analyzes access to public parks and their design
# Course Description + Objectives
My understanding is that this course will teach us the foundations of coding in Python as well as learn how to clean up large data sets and transform data into a user-friendly visual. 
I'm intersted in learning how to take a wide range of data, analyze, and transform it into an appealing visual. I'm hoping that by the end of the class, to be quicker in coding and be able to apply my skills to projects at work.
